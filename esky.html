    <h1>Little Blue Esky</h1>
    <img src="esky.jfif">
    <p>Dan wandered around the yard, looking at all the things on sale. His parents had given him $20 in pocket money just that morning, and it was burning a hole in his pocket.</p>
    <p>His eyes fell on a little blue esky in the back corner of the yard. Nobody else appeared to be paying any attention to it, but to Dan, it was quite interesting. Just sitting there. Dan walked over to it. The man who was holding the sale noticed that Dan seemed quite interested in the esky, and walked over to him.</p>
    <p>"What's so interesting about that esky, eh?," he asked. "Oh, hi Mr Banks," replied Dan, "I don't really know why, but it's just kinda interesting.". Mr Banks looked at the esky. "You can have it if you want," he said, "I don't really need it, but if it interests you, you can have it for free.". Dan thanked him, and took the esky.</p>
    <p>This particular esky was unusual. It had wheels and a handle like a suitcase. Dan was able to roll it around as he looked at the rest of the things being sold at the yard sale.</p>
    <p>That afternoon, Dan returned home with the esky and some of the other trinkets he'd bought. His parents looked at him quizzically. "What's with the esky?," they asked. Dan shrugged, "It just caught my eye.". His dad looked stern. "I hope you didn't waste all of your money on that," he said.<br/>"I didn't," replied Dan, "Mr Banks told me I could have it for free.".</p>
    <p>Dan knew that his parents wouldn't understand why he had an esky. Then again, he didn't quite understand either.</p>
    <p>When he opened the esky to get the other things he'd bought, he found that there were several six packs of beer in the esky as well as the rest of what he'd bought that day. <i>Odd,</i> he thought, <i>the esky was empty when I bought it, and I never saw any beer in there when I was putting those other things in there.</i> He decided to show his parents the six packs of beer. They were confused. "Please tell me you didn't buy that booze," said Dad. <br/>"I didn't," Dan replied, "when I was getting the other things I bought out of the esky, I found the beer in there. That was the first time I ever saw it.".<br/>"Bring me the esky," said Dad.</p>
    <p>Dan brought the esky to his dad. When Dad opened it, there was more booze, this time it was several bottles of wine. "This is one weird esky," he said, "but it gives us free stuff, so I guess it's worth keeping around.".</p>
    <p>From then on, Dan's parents used the esky to stock up on alcohol before family events.</p>
