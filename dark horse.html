    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>On cold winter nights, a frosty wind would across the moors, whistling and howling, bringing with it an angry spirit. Few dared to cross the moors, for they are terrified of the spirit which called these moors home - that of the <i>Dark Horse</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>Dark Horse</i> galloped across the moors, and one look into its eyes was said to be enough to chill one to the bone. Few know why it haunted the moors, but it did for centuries.</p>
    <p>If one ventures into the heart of the moors, one will find a small group of buildings, burnt cottages and barns and other miscellaneous buildings, just as I did. Little did I know what I'd stumbled into. This is the story.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p>I stumbled through bushes, looking for an adventure. Suddenly, I found myself among what appeared to be a small village. <i>Thats odd,</i> I thought to myself, <i>I've never seen this village before.</i> It was true - I hadn't seen that little village before. I don't think anyone had laid eyes on it for quite a while - years, maybe even centuries.</p>
    <p>As I explored the village, one thing became quite apparent. There was a smell of burnt wood, and some of the buildings looked like they'd burnt down. Before I knew it, the sun was starting to set. I tried to leave the village, but something stopped me.</p>
    <p>A shadow loomed over me.</p>
    <p>I turned around and gulped - I was face to face with it, the <i>Dark Horse</i>.</p>
    <p><q>What do you want with me?,</q> I asked it. <i>Right,</i> I thought to myself, <i>Ask the ghost horse. I'm not crazy or anything, I just have a death wish.</i> Then the horse spoke to me.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <p>The horse had a booming voice with a strong accent although I couldn't tell what the accent was. This is what it said to me:<blockquote>You, mortal, have found the lost village. It burnt down hundreds of years ago, and everybody fled, leaving me behind to die. I thought I was valued, but I wasn't.</blockquote><q>Why do you run across the moor at night?,</q> I asked. The horse replied, <blockquote>To guide others back to my stable, so they may do me a favour. I wish to be buried.</blockquote></p>
    <p><q>I can't bury a ghost,</q> I replied. <q>Don't be stupid,</q> said the horse, <q>I want you to bury my bones.</q> The horse walked over to a stable, so I followed it. In the stable was a pile of bones. <q>How can I bury your bones without a shovel?,</q> I asked. A shovel suddenly appeared in my hands.</p>
    <p>I made quick work of burying the bones. I even carved a gravestone for the horse. it read: <blockquote><i>Titan</i><br/>1612 - 1618<br/>A loyal steed, tragically left to die.</blockquote> When I returned home the next morning, nobody questioned my absence. As for the horse, it was never seen again.</p>
