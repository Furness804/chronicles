    <p>On cold winter nights, a frosty wind blows across the moors, whistling and howling, bringing with it an angry spirit. Few dare to cross the moors, for they are terrified of the spirit which calls these moors home - that of the <i>Dark Horse</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>Dark Horse</i> gallops across the moors, and one look into its eyes is said to be enough to chill one to the bone. Nobody knows why it haunts the moors, but it does, as it has for centuries.</p>
    <p>If one ventures into the heart of the moors, one will find a small group of buildings, burnt cottages and barns and other miscellaneous buildings, just as I did.</p>
