    <h1>Dark Horse</h1>

    <p>On cold winter nights, a frosty wind would across the moors, whistling and howling, bringing with it an angry spirit. Few dared to cross the moors, for they are terrified of the spirit which called these moors home - that of the <i>Dark Horse</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>Dark Horse</i> galloped across the moors, and one look into its eyes was said to be enough to chill one to the bone. Few know why it haunted the moors, but it did for centuries.</p>
    <p>If one ventures into the heart of the moors, one will find a small group of buildings, burnt cottages and barns and other miscellaneous buildings, just as I did. Little did I know what I'd stumbled into. This is the story.</p>
    <p>I stumbled through bushes, looking for an adventure. Suddenly, I found myself among what appeared to be a small village. <i>Thats odd,</i> I thought to myself, <i>I've never seen this village before.</i> It was true - I hadn't seen that little village before. I don't think anyone had laid eyes on it for quite a while - years, maybe even centuries.</p>
    <p>As I explored the village, one thing became quite apparent. There was a smell of burnt wood, and some of the buildings looked like they'd burnt down. Before I knew it, the sun was starting to set. I tried to leave the village, but something stopped me.</p>
    <p>A shadow loomed over me.</p>
    <p>I turned around and gulped - I was face to face with it, the <i>Dark Horse</i>.</p>
    <p><q>What do you want with me?,</q> I asked it. <i>Right,</i> I thought to myself, <i>Ask the ghost horse. I'm not crazy or anything, I just have a death wish.</i> Then the horse spoke to me.</p>
    <p><blockquote>I was a loyal steed. The villagers always told me that I was their "champion". I thought those villagers appreciated me, but when their village started burning down, they left me behind. <i>They forgot me.</i></blockquote></p>
    <p>I paused. <i>Champion?,</i> I thought to myself, <i>Why does that name sound familiar?</i></p>
    <p>Then I remembered. On my local high street, there was a Tudor-style building. It was called the Champion Inn. <q>They didn't forget you,</q> I said to the horse, <q>They named an inn after you.</q>. The horse stamped its hoof. <q>Show me,</q> it said.</p>
    <p>So I did. I led the horse across the moors into the town where I lived. People walking around on the high street gawked at the sight of the Dark Horse. The horse looked uncomfortable, but kept following.</p>
    <p>Eventually, we stopped at the Tudor-style building. There was the sign, hanging over the front door. It featured an emblem of a black horse above the words <q><i>Champion Inn</i></q>. I turned around to face the horse. <q>See?,</q> I asked, <q>You weren't forgotten, at least not completely.</q>. The horse spoke,</p>
    <p><blockquote>Sure, my name survives, but does my memory?</blockquote></p>
    <p><q>It does,</q> I reply, <q>there's an entire exhibit dedicated to you in the local history museum.</q> The horse stamps its hoof. <q>Show me,</q> it commands.</p>
    <p>We walk further down the high street, stopping outside of the local history museum. I knock on the door. The museum owner, a charismatic old man called Mr Chalmers, almost immediately opens it. <q>You brought it into town?,</q> he asks, gesturing towards the horse. <q>He wants to know that he hasn't been forgotten,</q> I reply. Mr Chalmers opens the door and gestures for us to come in.</p>
    <p>The three of us walk through the museum until we reach the back corner. <q>You haven't been forgotten, Mr Horse,</q> says Mr Chalmers, <q>look.</q> He points to a large sign on the wall next to an illustration of a black horse. The sign reads:</p>
    <p><blockquote>Champion the horse was lost when the old village burnt down. The man who was tasked with making sure that Champion was safe selfishly fled the burning village without freeing the valued steed. When this was discovered, the man was banished from the village.</blockquote></p>
    <p>When Chalmers and I turned to face the horse again, it was gone. It has never been seen since.</p>
